# A Chat with A Deity ðŸŒ§ðŸŒˆ

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). If you run it locally via `npm run start` you will be able to view the chat locally (on http://localhost:3000). But we'd like you to try it on Azure Static Sites! 

To do this, follow these steps:

1. Fork this repo to your own GitHub account and login to the [Azure Portal](https://ms.portal.azure.com/#home).

2. Create a new resource, configured as an Azure Static App

`provide screenshot here`

3. Connect your GitHub repo to the new Azure Static App

4. Watch your GitHub Actions for the build to complete, and enjoy the chat!
